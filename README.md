# MusicPic.
This is my portfolio 2 project for the Code Institute Full-stack developer course.

MusicPic is an in-hand music quiz mainly aimed at people on the go. The idea of the website is to be something that is fun but also educational and inspires users to discover music. Test your knowledge of music and have fun on your way to work or with friends on a game night.
I tried to develop a website that was easy to use and navigate. The website provides easy access to Spotify and Wikipedia, so the user can expand on what they've learnt and explore music. 
I have gotten great feedback concerning the layout and design. In addition, the test subjects all expressed that they would enjoy such a game on a game night with friends. The only negative comments were the small question pool. At the moment there are only 15 questions, but I can and intend to increase this in the future.

## Project planning:

### The site's Wireframe (Click "Details" below).

<details>

</details>

I started this project by creating a wireframe using Balsamic.

## Layout and Features:

 ![Responsive test](docs/musicpic-responsivity.png)

[Used amiresponsive for responsivity testing](https://amiresponsive.co.uk.)

### The landing page:
![Landing Page](docs/musicpic-landing-page.png)

The landing page consists of a Header in bright yellow, a themed background of old radios and an area with instructions and, a start button that takes you to the game page.
Located at the bottom of the page are links to Facebook, Instagram, Spotify and Wikipedia. The latter two are features added for the user to have easy access to expand upon the game. By using Spotify, one could easily add a music streaming element to the game. Wikipedia adds extra information on the topic at hand. 

### Game page:

![Game Page](docs/musicpic-question-page.png)

The game page is again made up of the header and instructions.

The questions are shuffled before each game starts.

Underneath is the hint image which is related to a song title.

Below the hint image is a clue written in the form of an anecdote or fact.

Following the image, players have a multiple-choice button area to make a selection from. 
After an answer has been selected, it automatically jumps to the next question and the new score is shown beneath.
After five questions have been answered, a total score out of five is presented along with the possibility of starting a new game.

### Other tests:

+ Launched and ran the page on Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge without any problems.
+ Launched and ran the page on a MacBook Air, Dell 7520 laptop, and a Mac Mini (Screen dimensions: 1920 x 1200px.)
+ The page worked on several hand-held devices of different sizes.
+ I also constantly worked with Chrome Dev Tools to trouble shoot, experiment and check responsivity.

## Bug fixes and ToDo:

+ Couldn't figure out how to shuffle the questions with a minimal amount of repetition.
   I discovered and used The Durstenfeld Shuffle.
   It seems like it might shuffle slightly better than the Fisher Yates shuffle.
   Using this method meant that the questions never repeated themselves in the same game.
   However shuffeling concept in JavaScript is a much more complex topic than I ever imagined and I am looking forward to finding a "flawless" algorithm.
+ Have had many typing errors during the course of this project, which has slowed down progress.
   I need to improve my typing accuracy.
+ The search compilation of the questions took so much longer than I thought.
   I would like to add more questions to the game in the future
+ I also wanted to add a scorecard feature for when the user wants to use it at a game night. Unfortunately, there wasn't time.
   I will implement this in the future. 


## Deployment:

+ In the repository section in GitHub, click on "MusicPic".
+ Click the 'Settings' in the middle near the top of the page.
+ On the left side of the page under "Code and Automation" select 'Pages' at the bottom of the section.
+ Under "Build and Deployment" > "Source" find the dropdown menu under "Branch" and select "Main".
+ Click the 'Save' button.
+ Deployment should be confirmed by a message on a green background saying "Your site is published at" followed by the web address.
