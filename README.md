# MusicPic.
This is my portfolio2 project for the Code Institute Full-stack developer course.

MusicPic is an in-hand music quiz mainly aimed at people on the go. The idea of the website is to be something fun to do on your way to work, for example. I tried to develop a website that is easy to use and navigate. Test your knowledge on music and have fun by yourself or with others, at a game night. Easy access to Spotify is already in the app and Wikipedia is linked at the bottom also if the user wants to expand on what they've learnt. The questions are based on a combination of an image and a hint. Players have a multiple-choice button area to make a selection from. After 5 questions a score is presented out of 5 and a possibility to restart a new game. I have gotten great feedback the only negative comments being a small question pool. I hope to increase this in the future.
