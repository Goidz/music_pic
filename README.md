# MusicPic.
This is my portfolio2 project for the Code Institute Full-stack developer course.

MusicPic is an in-hand music quiz mainly aimed at people on the go. The idea of the website is to be something that is fun but also educational and inspires to discover music. Test your knowledge on music and have fun on your way to work or with friends on a game night.
I tried to develop a website that is easy to use and navigate. The website provides easy access to Spotify and Wikipedia so the user can expand on what they've learnt and explore music. 
I have gotten great feedback concerning the layout and design. In addition, the test subjects all expressed that they would enjoy such a game on a game night with friends. The only negative comments were the small question pool. At the moment there are only 15 questions, but I can and intend to increase this in the future.

## Project planning.

### The site's Wireframe.

<details>

![Wireframe](docs/musicpic-wireframe.png)

I started this project by creating a wireframe using Balsamic.


## Layout and features.

[Used amiresponsive for responsivity testing](https://amiresponsive.co.uk.)

### The landing page.
![Landing Page](docs/musicpic-landing-page.png)

The landing page consists of a Header in bright yellow, a themed background of old radios and an area with instructions and a start button which takes you to the game page.
Located at the bottom of the page are links to Facebook, Instagram, Spotify and Wikipedia. The latter two are features added for the user to have easy access to expand upon the game. By using Spotify one could easily add a music streaming element to the game. Wikipedia adds extra information on a topic at hand. 

### Game page.

![Game Page](docs/musicpic-question-page.png)

The game page is again made up of the header and instrucctions.

The questions are shuffled before each game starts.

Underneath is the hint-image which is related to a song-title.

Below the hint-image is a clue written in the form of an anecdote or fact.

Following the image, players have a multiple-choice button area to make a selection from. 
After each question the current score is shown beneath this area.
After 5 questions have been answered, a total score out of 5 is presented together with a possibility to start a new game.

## Bug fixes and ToDo:

+ Couldn't figure out how to shuffle the questions with a minimal amount of repitition. I discovered and used The Durstenfeld Shuffle. It seems like it might shuffles slightly better than the Fisher Yates shuffle. However shuffeling is a much more complex topic than I ever imagined and I am looking forward to finding a flawless algorythm.
